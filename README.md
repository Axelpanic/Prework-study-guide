# Prework-study-guide
A study guide for the bootcamp prework

## Description

This is a study guide for the UW bootcamp I am taking. Not only was this a assignment, but it is an example of what I have learned prior to starting this coursework.
I learned basic CSS, Javascript, HTML, and Markdown as a result of this prework and can't wait to learn more.


## Installation

None! This work is for me alone!

## Usage

This guide is used as a study guide for myself for work in the future. It contains important information for using CSS, HTML, Markdown, and Javascript and I will add to it in the future.
